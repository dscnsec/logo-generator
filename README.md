# Winter of Code Ideas

- **Rebranding of the DSC logo** : Rebranding of the DSC to GDSC as the google has changed the brand name for the student community.
- **General speed up of the tool** : The tool is written in React and is not using code splitting currently, hence making it slow to load initially. Speeding this up would be good.
- **SEO improvements** : The tool has poor SEO currently.
- **Profiles and Saving generated logos** : Users should be able to login into the tool and save their generated logos for future re-download. This will help the returning users of the tool.
- If time permits we can extend support to other above mentioned communities.
